## Timeline
**Total Estimated Time:** 26-34 hours  
**Target Completion:** Phase-by-phase implementation  
**Critical Path:** Phases 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 7 (core functionality)

**Current Phase:** Phase 1.5 - Critical Safety Fixes (Boot Loop Prevention) ‚úÖ

**EMERGENCY FIXES COMPLETED:**
- ‚úÖ **SpringBoard injection REMOVED** - Primary boot loop cause eliminated
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive error handling** - All hooks wrapped in @try/@catch
- ‚úÖ **File I/O operations ELIMINATED** - No disk access during boot
- ‚úÖ **Safe MediaManager initialization** - Lazy loading only
- ‚úÖ **Minimal hook scope** - Camera app only, UIImagePickerController only
- ‚úÖ **OverlayView temporarily removed** - Will re-add after stability confirmed

**SAFETY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED:**
- Bundle filter: Camera app ONLY (no system processes)
- Hook scope: Basic camera redirect ONLY (no AVFoundation/WebView)
- Memory management: All operations use safe variants
- Initialization: NO boot-time operations
- Logging: Extensive debugging for any issues

**NEXT INSTALL SHOULD BE SAFE** - No more boot loops expected

**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Project Foundation & Setup (Safe Mode)
